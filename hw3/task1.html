    <p><dfn>Thanksgiving Day</dfn> is a national holiday in the United States, and Thanksgiving 2019 
      occurs on Thursday, November 28. In 1621, the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag Indians
      shared an autumn harvest feast that is acknowledged today as one of 
      the first Thanksgiving celebrations in the colonies. For more than two centuries, 
      days of thanksgiving were celebrated by individual colonies and states. It wasn’t 
      until <del>1862 </del> <ins> 1863</ins>, in the midst of the <ins>Civil War </ins> , that President
      <ins> Abraham Lincoln proclaimed </ins> a national Thanksgiving Day to be held each November.</p>

      In many American households, the Thanksgiving celebration has lost much of its 
      original religious significance; instead, it now centers on cooking and sharing 
      a bountiful meal with family and friends. Turkey, a Thanksgiving staple so
      ubiquitous it has become all but synonymous with the holiday, may or may not have 
      been on offer when the Pilgrims hosted the inaugural feast in 1621. Today, however, 
      nearly 90 percent of Americans eat the bird—whether roasted, baked or deep-fried—on 
      Thanksgiving, according to the National Turkey Federation. Other traditional foods 
      include stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie. Volunteering is 
      a common Thanksgiving Day activity, and communities often hold food drives and host 
      free dinners for the less fortunate. </p>

      <p>Parades have also become an integral part of the holiday in cities and towns across 
        the United States. Presented by Macy’s department store since 1924, New York City’s 
        Thanksgiving Day parade is the largest and most famous, attracting some 2 to 3 million 
        spectators along its 2.5-mile route and drawing an enormous television audience. 
        It typically features marching bands, performers, elaborate floats conveying various 
        celebrities and giant balloons shaped like cartoon characters.Beginning in the 
        mid-20th century and perhaps even earlier, the president of the 
        <abbr title="United States ">U.S.</abbr> has <q>pardoned</q> one or two Thanksgiving turkeys each year, sparing the birds from 
        slaughter and sending them to a farm for retirement. A number of U.S. governors 
        also perform the annual turkey pardoning ritual.</p>
